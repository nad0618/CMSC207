## About Me <a name = "about"></a>

I am Renald Cruz, a Finance Systems Administrator at International School Manila, where I optimize NetSuite and streamline internal systems. Beyond my work, I am expanding my expertise by pursuing a Master of Information Systems while diving deeper into web development. For me, continuous learning isn’t optional—it’s essential.
